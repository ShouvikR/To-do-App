# to-do-app

There are list of small projects that I've done during my Web Dev Bootcamp in Juno. Its one of them.
I used: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript for this project.
Whatever you type and submit will add as a list.
You can check the item from the list when it is done.
Also you can toggle and uncheck.
Very simple and easy to understand.
